        The Story in the Book
    </h1>
    <h4>
        Chapter 1
    </h4>
    <p>
        Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of Nature,
        New Scientist, and all the other 
        <br>
        scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <i>On The
        Road. </i> It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she
        <br>
        spent in these four walls the more
        she felt she needed to be free.

        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
        "Work is the refuge of people who have
        <br>
        nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work,
        unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly
        <br>
        did think she had something
        better to do.
